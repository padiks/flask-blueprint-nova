# Building a Modular and Scalable Flask Blueprint Architecture **(Nova theme from FreeBootstrap)**

A modular and scalable mini “production-ready” Flask skeleton designed as a clean starting point for any project, using Flask Blueprints to keep features isolated, maintainable, and easy to extend. This project focuses on simplicity and structure rather than complexity, and it uses the **Nova theme from FreeBootstrap** for the frontend layout and styling, with proper attribution and licensing as provided by FreeBootstrap.
